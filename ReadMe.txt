First Orchard Player

By Stephen Hall

These Python programs play the childrenâ€™s board game First Orchard (HABA, 2009). 

"FirstOrchard" is the original file, with move-by-move text output. Each turn, the player must press Enter to roll the die.
"FirstOrchardAutoPlay" is the same program, but it plays automatically, without requiring input from the player. When the basket result is rolled, the fruit with the most remaining is automatically chosen.
"FirstOrchardTextless" plays automatically, but with no output.
"FirstOrchardPlayer" plays the game many times and generates visual output.
